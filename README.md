## Hey reader!

I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence. 🤓 I have a great grasp of Python, C++, C, Java, and SQL and have worked on numerous small-scale and large-scale projects in these languages! 😬

Some non-nerdy things about me 👻: I enjoy playing football A LOT. I am also a part-time freelance direct response copywriter. One more thing, I enjoy teaching too 😁! I have taught multiple students O levels and IGCSE mathematics, business studies, and economics!
